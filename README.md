Full Stack Web Developer | Software Engineer | Python & JavaScript Specialist | AI Enthusiast | Cybersecurity Advocate | Data Visualization Pro | Graphic Designer | Public Speaker | Author

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with expertise in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), specializing in building scalable and dynamic web applications. I’m experienced in both frontend and backend development, with a strong focus on authentication (JWT, OAuth), RESTful API design, and frameworks like React.js and Express.js. I have hands-on experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and deployment tools including Docker, Heroku, and Netlify.

As a Software Engineer, I embrace best practices in data structures, algorithms, and design patterns (MVC, Singleton, Factory), ensuring efficient, maintainable code. I also follow Agile methodologies and use Git/GitHub for version control.

I have solid Python experience, with Flask and Django for web development, as well as data analysis using Pandas and NumPy. My interests also extend to Machine Learning (TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI), and AI applications like NLP and predictive modeling.

I'm passionate about Cybersecurity, advocating for secure coding practices, ethical hacking, and vulnerability assessments. I stay up to date with industry standards such as OWASP Top 10.

With a creative flair, I’m also a Graphic Designer, skilled in UI/UX design and creating visually engaging user interfaces using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, and Canva.

As a Public Speaker and Author, I love sharing my expertise in software development, AI, and technology innovation. I write articles, host talks, and encourage others to adopt a growth mindset in tech.
